,,Atom Identities,,,,
Atom IDs,Pick a name for your sites!,C-1,C-2,N-3,O-4,O-5
Element IDs,Define an element; all sites must be homogeneous at this level to allow us to calculate delta values,C,C,N,O,O
Stoichiometry,Define how many equivalent atoms are in this site,1,1,1,1,1
Equivalence,"Use this to construct heterogeneous indistinguishable sites; any perfectly constrained atom is 0. Define two sites as indistinguishable by giving them the same equivalence number, starting from 1",0,0,0,0,0
